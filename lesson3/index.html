                <p>The second person that might come to this site will be families that are moving in to the area for the first time and are wanting to know important information from our community.

                <h2>Scenarios</h2>
                <p>Scenario #1: Microsoft is looking to open a new business office because they want to move out of silicon valley but they need to know what amenities the community offers because when they ask employees who would consider moving. They want to provide them with a list of family things to do around the area, restaurants available and past events that show Conroe as a family friendly city.</p>

                <p>Scenario #2: Mark owns a small local fresh bread company in the neighboring city and it is doing so well that he is considering opening a second location in Conroe, Tx. Before he commits to investing money to open a new location he would come to this site to see if there are bread companies already available to the public. If there are bread companies available, he would be able to see a website link to their page to see if his services would be different and his competition. Location is also important so with the address he would be able to better make a decision where the hot spots are where people often visit.</p>

                <p>Scenario #3: The Hillshire family just moved into town and Conroe, Tx is known for hurricane season. They recently saw in facebook that hurricane season is coming and that families should start to prepare for it but they came from a northern state where hurricanes are mythical so the Hillshire's don't know what they need. A visit to the Conroe Chamber of Commerce site will provide a bulleting board that will have links and prepare checklists of things needed. Along with this usefully information, there will be suggested stores to visit that contain the things you will need. Now the Hillshire family feels more at peace knowing they have a checklist of items they need and phone numbers to keep on hand in case of emergencies.</p>

                <p>Scenario #4: Mister Hillshire has just been promoted and offered a job that is located in Houston, Tx. It is an opportunity he cannot pass on but he knows after previously visiting Houston that it is not a place he would like to move his family because they like the smaller, country town living. While doing a google search, he came across Conroe, Tx. which is just 30-40 minutes north of where his new office is located. As he visits the Conroe City Chamber of Commerce, he is gathering information of what Conroe has to offer and what surrounding amenities are available that will help him and his wife make the decision if Conroe is the place to move.</p>

                <p>Scenario #5: The Hillshire family is going on vacation to Texas and while there, they want to visit the church on Sunday to have the sacrament but do not know if there is an LDS church there. When they visit the Conroe Chamber of Commerce, there is a link to a list of all the church's available in the area along with their address and an external link to the church's website so they can contact or see their hours of worship. This site will give them that option to see if a church is available to them while on their vacation and will help them plan their vacation accordingly on Sunday.</p>
